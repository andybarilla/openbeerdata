<h1>Open Beer Data Project</h1>
The Open Beer Data Project aims to provide a free, as in beer and as in speech, way to access
information related to beer and homebrewing.  This will hopefully serve as a unified place
to access data regarding ingredients and other information.  The key factor that distinguishes 
this project from others is that the main code is kept in a repository hosted by 
<a href="http://code.google.com/">Google</a> so that it is not reliant on any one person and it 
can be maintained even if everyone involves is replaced by replicants.<br />
<br />
The open beer database currently includes:
<ul>
	<li>Hops - general data</li>
	<li>Yeast - Wyeast and White Labs</li>
	<li>Grains/Fermentables - Breiss</li>
	<li>SRM Colors - srm to rgb mapping</li>
	<li>BJCP</li>
</ul>
The data involved, excluding the BJCP, is licensed under the <a href="http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/">Open Database License</a>
and can be used for any purpose, commercial or personal.<br />
<br />
The following data formats are currently avaiable:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">Sqlite</a> - <a href="openbeerdata.db">openbeerdata.db</a></li>
	<li>CSV files
		<ul>
			<li><a href="hops.csv">hops.csv</a></li>
			<li><a href="fermentables.csv">fermentables.csv</a></li>
			<li><a href="yeast.csv">yeast.csv</a></li>
			<li><a href="srm.csv">srm.csv</a></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<br />
If you have information to provide that is currently not included in the database or 
would like to keep your data updated regularly, please contact <a href="mailto:andrew@exit66.com">Andrew Barilla</a>.
I can work with you to automate the process as best as possible including data conversion.<br />
